# Multi Monitor Swap 

## Default shortcuts:

```
<Super><Shift>+h = Swap left
<Super><Shift>+j = Swap down
<Super><Shift>+k = Swap up
<Super><Shift>+l = Swap right

<Super>+h = Focus left
<Super>+i = Focus down
<Super>+u = Focus up
<Super>+l = Focus right

<Super>+j = Select down window stack for that monitor
<Super>+k = Select up window stack for that monitor
```

They can all be changed in the extension preferences.

## Installation

### Recommended:

Use the [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/) website to
install and enable the latest version.

### Manual:

1.  Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/dvrlabs/multimonitorswap $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/multimonitorswap@dvrlabs.tv
```

2. Restart GNOME, `ALT-F2` and run `r` to restart.

3. Enable the extension:

```
gnome-extensions enable multimonitorswap@dvrlabs.tv

```

## Issues

Invisible gjs windows can be a pain.

Disable "Desktop Icons NG (ding), ding@rastersoft.com" extension, or
if you use the feature flip through the window stack you'll hit an invisible window.
